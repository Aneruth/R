Columns that can be dropped: 

(Considering 0, '', unknown as missing values)

1. source_type --> repeated column
2. recorded_by --> no unique values present
3. amount_tsh --> too many missing values 
4. permit --> empty values of 3056 and moreover its of boolean type
5. public_meeting --> empty values of 3334 and moreover its of boolean type
6. scheme_name --> too many categorical values ~1000
7. can remove either water_quality or quality_group since they both are same
8. same for source, source_type and source_class can remove eihter of the column
9. waterpoint_type == waterpoint_type_group so can remove either one
10. ward --> drop the column cause it has more categorical values

Considerations:
1. payment --> there are 8157 unknown
2. extraction_type, extraction_type_group and extraction_type_class looks same so we can eliminate either one of them.

For construction_year we can convert all values with 0 to mean of that column

population --> convert 0 to NAN and consider the mean value
schmene_mngmt --> consider the top 5 values for empty strings
